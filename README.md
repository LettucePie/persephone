A simple game about creating/growing/sharing plants. Every Monday the player is given an "unremarkable seed" which they then customize many aspects of. After a week of taking care of the plant, it will produce it's own seeds which the player can then share with other players. Plant Customization involves the general size/type of plant, the arrangement of branches, the design of the leaves, and the arrangement of leaves on branches. Taking care of the plants is a simple task of opening the app and tapping on each plant in the players garden. I would like to implement a function that uses the local weather to detect if watering the plant is necessary that day. I also would like the function for the player to show their phone to something bright for a couple seconds, as a way to use the brightness detector to feed the plant sunlight.
